#Create a temperature.py program that converts a number from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C). Google the current temperature of Brooklyn, NY (where Codédex is based) in °F. Use the following formula and write it out in Python:
# It is 78 degreeds Fahrenheit in Brooklyn, as of right now.

temp_f = 78
temp_c = (temp_f - 32) / 1.8
print(temp_c)
